**My solutions to Advent of Code 2022 problems**

## Information

This is my first year attempting [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) having only recently discovered it and hope to participate in the years to come. I may solve problems from previous years in the near future.

Each folder contains solutions for both parts of the respective problem and the problem input data. The hierarchy below shows this:
```
day1
└───day1-part1.lua // Solution for part 1.
│   
└───day2-part2.lua // Solution for part 2.
|
└───day2.txt // Problem input data.
```
